== Running

echo "<commands>" | ./lambdamine <map>

echo "<commands>" | ./lambdamine -vv <map>

In not -vv mode it prints the current map every cycle.
In case of water present, it shows it as tilde [~] at the end of the line.

The input is smart in that it disregards newlines, which enables interactive running -- without -vv, 
you can issue commands and terminate them with newlines to get an updated map.
